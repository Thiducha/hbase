This packages contains tests decidated to MTTR validations. The umbrella JIRA is HBASE-5843.


MTTR tests makes sense mainly on a real cluster, even if sometimes some sub parts can be tested
with a minicluster.

There are 4 ways to lose a process:
- clean stop
- kill 15 - this leaves room for shutdown hooks.
- kill 9 - no shutdown hooks possible, but the OS will close the socket, and remote process will
    know if they want to connect to this process again.
- box disappeared - then the network layer cannot distinguish between a slow box and a dead box. We
    then rely on timemouts.


As well you can lose a regionserver or a regionserver and a datanode. Losing a datanode is much
 more complex than losing a single regionserver, as we are also losing the data, and as we have
 now a dependency on HDFS recovery.

For this reason, MTTR tests use HDFS versions built locally.


Lastly, to simulate a dead box, we rely on firewall configuration. This requires a C program own by
 root with the sticky bit on.

So to use the mttr test you must:
 1) Compile the C program in dev-support with 'sudo dev-support/it_test_make.sh'. This should be done
        only once per installation.
 2) Compile Hadoop. Step to be redone if you change Hadoop of course.
 3) Then HBase on top of the Hadoop version built. Step to be redone if you change Hadoop or HBase of course.
 4) Have a proper configuration on all the machine you're using: Java version, user accounts, SSH config & so on.
 5) Copy the products just build on all the machine you're going to use. This is done by the script
      in hase-it/src/test/scripts/setup.sh. This requires a proper installation of ssh.
      This setp should be redone after each rebuild of Hadoop or HBase
 6) Run the integration tests with
mvn package test verify -Dit.test="IntegrationTestRecoveryEmptyTable*" -Dtest=nonono -pl hbase-it -Dhadoop.profile=2.0

 If you modify just the tests, you don't have to rerun the previous tests.
